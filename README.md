This is the base code for all knightkrawler robot code. This code was built with intelliJ, and does not use the command based programming framwork. 
I specifally wrote most of the autonomous framework and oversaw all other parts of the code.

This code includes:
  * An Autonomous Framework
  * PurePersuitPathFollowing
  * Position detection
  * Subsystem code
